## Project Overview
This project was undertaken as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification. The objective was to analyze smart device usage data to uncover trends and provide actionable insights for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The insights derived aimed to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy and enhance their product offerings.

## Business Task
Analyze smart device usage data to identify trends and behaviors among consumers, and apply these insights to one of Bellabeat's products to inform marketing strategies.

## Stakeholders
- **Primary Stakeholders**:
  - Urška Sršen: Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat
  - Sando Mur: Co-founder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team
- **Secondary Stakeholders**:
  - Bellabeat marketing analytics team

## Data Sources
The analysis was based on the [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) available on Kaggle. This dataset comprises personal fitness tracker data from 30 Fitbit users, including minute-level data on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Data Storage and Querying**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Data Visualization**: Tableau
- **Analysis Techniques**: Data analysis and marketing strategy formulation

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
Given the time elapsed since the project completion, specific data cleaning steps are not fully recalled. However, standard procedures likely included:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Identifying and addressing missing or null values to ensure data completeness.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Eliminating duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
- **Data Formatting**: Standardizing date and time formats for consistency.
- **Filtering Data**: Selecting relevant columns and rows pertinent to the analysis objectives.

## Analysis
The analysis focused on identifying patterns in device usage, step counts, and sleep behaviors among Fitbit users. These patterns were then contextualized to understand how Bellabeat's customer base might exhibit similar behaviors, thereby informing targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Findings
- **Device Usage Patterns**: Users displayed varying levels of engagement with their fitness trackers, indicating segments of active and less active users.
- **Step Counts**: There were observable trends in daily step counts, with certain periods showing higher activity levels.
- **Sleep Patterns**: Analysis revealed common sleep durations and patterns among users, providing insights into user lifestyles.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following strategies were proposed to enhance Bellabeat's market presence:
- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns**: Develop campaigns tailored to identified customer segments, potentially increasing market reach.
- **Personalized App Notifications**: Implement notifications based on user activity patterns to boost engagement.
- **Incentivization Programs**: Create rewards programs encouraging users to achieve specific health goals, thereby enhancing user retention.

*Note: The specific percentage increases mentioned in the initial recommendations were illustrative. Actual figures should be determined through A/B testing and user feedback.*

## Limitations
- **Sample Size**: The dataset comprised only 30 users, limiting the generalizability of findings.
- **Data Recency**: Data was collected in 2016; user behaviors and market dynamics may have evolved since then.
- **Demographic Information**: Lack of demographic data (e.g., gender, age) restricted deeper analysis relevant to Bellabeat's target market.

## Future Work
- **Expand Data Collection**: Gather data from a larger and more diverse user base to enhance analysis reliability.
- **Update Data Sources**: Utilize more recent datasets to reflect current user behaviors and market trends.
- **Incorporate Demographic Data**: Collect demographic information to enable more targeted and relevant insights.
